## 2. Design and Architecture

XLang is designed to bridge high-level scripting with low-level performance optimization. Its core design principles include:

- **Python-Like Syntax and Dynamic Typing:**  
  XLang adopts a syntax similar to Python, which enables developers to write code quickly with intuitive constructs. Although it retains dynamic typing and an indentation-based block structure, XLang introduces certain modifications—such as an optional semicolon (`;`) for clarity inspired by C/C++.

- **Dynamic Programming:**  
  In XLang, functions, lambda expressions, and classes are first-class objects. This dynamic nature allows them to be created, assigned, and passed as variables, fostering a flexible programming paradigm.

- **Concurrency and Distributed Execution:**  
  A native task model permits any XLang function to be executed asynchronously. This, coupled with explicit lock and unlock methods for thread safety, allows XLang to overcome limitations such as the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) seen in other languages.

- **Interoperability and Integration:**  
  The language provides seamless integration with Python and other ecosystems (including C++, C#, and Java). Bidirectional interoperability is a key feature: XLang modules can be imported into Python projects and vice versa, enabling developers to leverage the best libraries from multiple languages.

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:**  
  XLang supports JIT compilation via function annotations, enabling performance-critical sections to be dynamically compiled into machine code. This approach yields significant speed improvements, particularly for compute-intensive tasks.

## 3. XLang Language Specification

The following section details the core specifications of XLang, with modifications and expanded explanations to provide context and clarity for developers and researchers.

### 3.1 Core Programming Features

XLang is designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind. Its core features include:

- **Functions and Lambda Expressions:**  
  Functions in XLang are first-class citizens, meaning they can be dynamically created, assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and executed. Lambda functions offer a concise syntax for inline operations.

- **Class Support and Object Orientation:**  
  Classes in XLang are also first-class objects. They can be dynamically created and assigned as variables. The language supports the use of the `this` keyword for referring to instance members, and class names may serve as constructors. Additionally, classes can include events (e.g., `on_move:event`) that are triggered using a concise syntax (e.g., `on_move(1, 23)`).

### 3.2 Data Types

XLang supports a variety of data types to facilitate both simple and complex programming needs:

- **Primitive Types:**  
  - **number:** Encompasses int, 64-bit int, float, and double.
  - **const string:** Immutable strings defined directly in code.

- **Composite and Special Types:**  
  - **Mutable String:** A string type that can be modified after creation.
  - **Collections:** Includes standard types such as lists, dictionaries, and sets.
  - **Complex Numbers:** A dedicated type for complex arithmetic.
  - **struct:** Similar to C++ structures for user-defined types.
  - **error:** A specific type for error handling.
  - **table:** A structured type for table-like data.
  - **bin:** Designed for handling bytes and binary data.
  - **Dynamic Attributes:**  
    All non-primitive types support `setattr()` and `getattr()`, allowing dynamic association of attributes with any object.

### 3.3 Advanced Language Features

XLang goes beyond basic programming constructs by incorporating several advanced features:

- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Operations:**  
  The language fully supports AST manipulation, enabling dynamic code transformation and metaprogramming.

- **Event Handling and Decorators:**  
  An integrated event system allows developers to register event handlers using `on(event_name, handler)`. Python-like decorators (using `@decor_name(parameters)`) facilitate meta-programming and code modifications at runtime.

- **Pipe Operator and Namespaces:**  
  The pipe operator (`x | y`) is used for chaining operations, where the output of one expression is passed as input to another. Hierarchical namespaces (e.g., `namespace xlang.ca.san_jose.jack.OK = 10.33`) support organized, modular code.

### 3.4 Module and Import System

- **Import Support:**  
  XLang can import native objects, XLang modules, and even Python modules directly. Deferred imports are supported via a `.load()` method, allowing modules to be loaded later in the program execution.

### 3.5 Integration and Interoperability

- **Python Integration:**  
  XLang’s design includes native support for importing and executing Python modules, with the capability of bidirectional interoperability—XLang modules can be used in Python projects and vice versa.

- **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and Bridges:**  
  Specialized DSLs such as an SQL DSL (for inline database queries) and a Bash DSL (for executing shell commands) are built into XLang. Furthermore, integration bridges for C# and Java enhance the language’s versatility, especially in mobile and desktop application development.

### 3.6 Easy C++ Integration

  XLang simplifies integration with C++ via a macro-based system. Key macros include:
  - **BEGIN_PACKAGE** and **END_PACKAGE:** Delimit package definitions.
  - **APISET():** Registers functions, properties, classes, and events with the package.
  
  In XLang, a package is a first-class object that supports serialization (for saving, transferring, and reloading) and remote access via inter-process communication.

### 3.7 Task and Concurrency Features

- **Task Execution and Pooling:**  
  Any function can be dispatched as a task using `func_name.taskrun(pool, params)`, returning a future object for result retrieval or cancellation.
  
- **Locking Mechanisms:**  
  All mutable types support `lock()` and `unlock()` to ensure thread safety during concurrent execution.

### 3.8 Add-In Native Modules

XLang includes several add-in native modules that extend its functionality:

  XLang supports serialization of both data types (including recursive data structures) and code (functions and class definitions). Serialized objects can be converted to and from bytes, facilitating state persistence and dynamic code loading.

### 3.11 Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

- **Remote Procedure Calls and Event Handlers:**  
  XLang supports fast remote procedure calls via shared memory, making remote calls appear as local function calls. Event handlers can reference remote functions or methods, streamlining cross-process interactions.

### 3.12 Built-In Parsers

- **JSON and HTML Parsers:**  
  The language includes parsers for JSON and HTML, enabling efficient data handling and DOM tree construction for web-related applications.

### 3.13 Code Embedding and JIT Compilation

- **@jit Annotation:**  
  Developers can annotate functions or class definitions with `@jit(parameters)` to enable dynamic compilation of embedded C++ (or other supported languages) into machine code. This facilitates high-performance execution and seamless integration with native libraries.
- **Dynamic Compilation:**  
  Modified code is automatically recompiled, and future support for multiple languages is planned.

### 3.14 Tooling and Development Environment

## 6. Code Examples

Below are simplified code examples that illustrate XLang’s syntax and capabilities:

### Example 1: Python Interoperability

```python
import os
x = os.getcwd()             # Retrieve current working directory from Python's os module
x0 = to_xlang(x)            # Convert Python string to XLang string
import simple_module        # Import a Python module
pid = simple_module.print_func("Hello from XLang")
x_pid = to_xlang(pid)       # Convert result to XLang type
print("Finished running")
```

*Explanation:*  
This example shows how XLang imports Python modules, converts Python data types to XLang types, and seamlessly executes Python functions from within XLang.

### Example 2: Tensor and Image Operations

```python
from xlang_image import Factory

im = Factory.Image("bg.jpg")             # Load an image file
t = im.to_tensor(Factory.rgba)           # Convert the image to a tensor in RGBA format

# Process the tensor (e.g., applying a convolution or neural network inference)

new_im = Factory.Image("bg_new.jpg")     # Create a new image object
new_im.from_tensor(t)                    # Convert processed tensor back to image format
new_im.save()                            # Save the new image
```

*Explanation:*  
This snippet demonstrates XLang’s capabilities in handling image data and performing tensor operations. It highlights the language’s strength in AI-related tasks where on-device image processing is required.
