## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the **XLang** community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a **harassment‑free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy** community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take **appropriate and fair corrective action** in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to **remove, edit, or reject** comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces—such as GitHub repositories, Discord or Slack channels, mailing lists, forums, conferences, and social media—and also applies when an individual is **officially representing the project or community** in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

---

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at **conduct\@xlang‑foundation.org**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and **fairly**. All community leaders are obligated to respect the **privacy and security** of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Process

1. **Acknowledgement** – We will acknowledge receipt of the report within one business day.
2. **Investigation** – Two or more designated maintainers will gather additional information and interview parties as needed.
3. **Decision** – The maintainers will determine the appropriate response, which may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent expulsion.
4. **Communication** – We will communicate our decision to the reporter (and, where appropriate, to the offender) while maintaining confidentiality.
5. **Appeal** – If the reporter or offender disagrees with the decision, they may appeal to the XLang Foundation Board within 30 days.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these **Community Impact Guidelines** in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:
